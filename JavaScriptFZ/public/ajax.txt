# iA Writer Pro for iPad and iPhone
iA Writer Pro introduces professional tools to help you craft your text:

## Keyboard Bar
This contains navigation and language-specific punctuation, plus a thumb tab in the center. Swipe the thumb tab down to hide the keyboard. Swipe it left to show Edit, Syntax, and Statistics, then right to return to language-specific punctuation.

## Syntax Control (in the Keyboard Bar)
Syntax Control dims everything but the chosen syntax (Adjectives, Nouns, Adverbs, Verbs, Prepositions, or Conjunctions) for English text. This gives you insight into how your text is constructed, to help control your writing style. Choose Sentence to dim everything but the current sentence, helping you to concentrate fully and find your flow.

## Workflow
iA Writer Pro’s simple workflow is built around how you work. Start by structuring your thoughts and ideas in Note, move to Write to flesh them out, progress to Edit for refining, then move to Read when you’re done (documents in Read are read-only). These Workflow states keep you focused on the task at hand, and each has a task-specific font and color.
